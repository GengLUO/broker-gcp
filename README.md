### Architectural Overview

1. **Booking Service**: This service publishes booking events (e.g., hotel or flight booking requests) to the Pub/Sub system. It interacts with the Transaction Coordinator for managing distributed transactions.

2. **Transaction Coordinator Service**: Manages two-phase commit (2PC) protocols to ensure atomic and consistent transactions across multiple services (e.g., flight booking service, hotel booking service, and Firestore).

3. **Pub/Sub System**: Acts as a message broker to facilitate communication between services. The Booking Service publishes events, and the Flight and Hotel Booking Services subscribe to these events.

4. **Flight Booking Service**: Subscribes to events from the Pub/Sub system and participates in 2PC managed by the Transaction Coordinator.

5. **Hotel Booking Service**: Similarly, subscribes to events and participates in 2PC.

6. **Firestore Database**: Stores data and participates in 2PC to ensure consistent state across the distributed system.

7. **RAFT Consensus**: Ensures log consistency across distributed nodes, which helps maintain a consistent state in the system. It is particularly useful for leader election and ensuring a single source of truth in the system.

8. **PBFT Algorithm**: Handles Byzantine faults to ensure the system can tolerate and function correctly even if some nodes exhibit arbitrary or malicious behavior. This is particularly important in environments where nodes may not be fully trusted.

### Interaction Flow
Interaction and Integration

To understand how these components interact, letâ€™s walk through a hypothetical travel booking scenario:

1. **Initiating a Booking (Pub/Sub + Transactional RPC)**:
   - The client initiates a booking request.
   - The booking service publishes a message to a Pub/Sub topic indicating a new booking request.
   - Services like hotel booking, flight booking, and payment subscribe to this topic.

2. **Coordinating the Transaction (Transaction Coordinator + 2PC)**:
   - The transaction coordinator starts a new transaction.
   - The transaction coordinator sends prepare requests (part of 2PC) to the hotel booking, flight booking, and payment services.
   - Each service prepares by checking if the resources (rooms, flights, funds) are available and locks them.
   - Each service responds with a yes or no vote.

3. **Executing the Transaction (Transactional RPC + Firestore)**:
   - If all services vote yes, the transaction coordinator sends a commit request to all services.
   - Each service then commits the transaction, updating their state and Firestore with the booking details.
   - If any service votes no, the transaction coordinator sends an abort request, and all services revert any changes.

4. **Ensuring Consistency and Fault Tolerance (RAFT)**:
   - RAFT is used to ensure that the logs of operations (e.g., bookings) are consistent across all nodes.
   - If a node fails, RAFT ensures that a new leader is elected, and the state is consistent across the remaining nodes.

5. **Securing Fault Tolerant (PBFT)**:
- Ensures the system can handle and recover from arbitrary (Byzantine) failures.
- Requires additional complexity and integration of BFT algorithms.


### Roles of TransactionCoordinatorService and FirestoreController

1. **FirestoreController**:
   - **Role**: Acts as a REST controller to handle HTTP requests related to Firestore operations.
   - **Usage**: This is where you define your endpoints to interact with Firestore, including booking travel packages, adding documents, updating documents, etc.

2. **TransactionCoordinatorService**:
   - **Role**: Manages distributed transactions across multiple services, ensuring atomicity and consistency.
   - **Usage**: Implements the business logic for coordinating transactions, such as booking travel packages, and uses the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol.

## Add firebaseadminsdk
in the src/main/java/be.kuleuven.dsgt4/auth, create a new file called
```
firebase-adminsdk.json
```
Then copy and paste the follwing to this json file
```
The content is in our Whatsapp
```

## Setup and Execution
### Step 1: Run the Emulator Locally
    ./firebase-tools-linux emulators:start

    or

    firebase emulators:start

To change it to use the cloud, please change the index.js and the WebSecurityConfig
### Step 2: Start Spring application
    mvn spring-boot:run

### Step 3: Access the Application and Sign Up
  http://localhost:8080

### Step 4: Access the Firestore Emulator Firestore (database monitor)
  http://localhost:8081/firestore

### 3.1.1 REST Controller and WebClient
- **REST Controller**: Verify the REST controller included in the sample project is functioning as intended.
- **WebClient Development**: The WebClient component is missing and needs to be developed to interact with web services.

### 3.1.2 Web Security Configuration
- **Search for Configuration**: In the sample project, look for the following imports, which are related to web security:
  ```java
  import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
  import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
  ```
- **Current Configuration**: The "auth.WebSecurityConfig" and "SecurityFilter" in the sample code use a configuration that includes deprecated APIs.
- **Adaptation Strategy**: Update the security configuration by:
  1. Analyzing how Professor Bert configured the project.
  2. Reviewing how the sample project implemented these configurations.
  3. Developing our version based on the above findings.

### 3.1.3 Security Filter Comparison
- **Security Filter Analysis**: Compare the "SecurityFilter" implementation in our sample code, particularly looking at "JwtAuthenticationFilter", to identify similarities and differences.

### 3.1.4 Data Repository Integration
- **Repository Implementation**: The sample project uses a Spring Framework data repository.
- **Modification Requirement**: Modify the existing data repository implementation to utilize Firestore, aligning it with the project provided by Professor Bert.

This structured breakdown provides a clearer roadmap for your project tasks, focusing on what needs to be checked, developed, or adapted in your software development effort.
